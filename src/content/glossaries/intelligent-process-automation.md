content_raw: What is intelligent process automation? Intelligent process automation (IPA) delineates the fusion of various cutting-edge technologies including robotic process automation (RPA), process mining, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to create an adaptive and autonomous business process automation system. This advanced blend of technologies allows for business processes that think, learn, and adapt all while streamlining operational efficiency. The benefits of IPA for businesses are multifaceted. One of its significant advantages is enabling end-to-end processes, fostering a resilient and flexible business operating model that encourages innovation and essentially unlocks new business value. For successful IPA implementation, collaboration between business functions and IT is indispensable. This cooperative effort culminates in the evaluation of processes, followed by the incorporation of systems for a scalable and sustainable change. IPA makes use of a range of modern technologies including RPA software, process mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, machine learning, and AI. This remarkable amalgamation of technologies automates manual tasks across the enterprise, amplifying productivity and efficiency. In the current digital age, especially in a post-pandemic world, business resilience highly depends on optimised digital processes. IPA not only enhances efficiency and cuts costs but also supports business continuity, fulfilling the dynamic customer requirements and providing proactive and resilient business operations. Contrariwise, RPA focuses solely on the automation of repetitive manual tasks using software robots or bots. However, IPA goes beyond, integrating AI and other superior cognitive technologies to expand business process automation across the entire enterprise. Various success stories have reported significant business benefits achieved through effective IPA implementation. Thus, the strategic utilisation of IPA could significantly enhance productivity, streamline operational efficiency, and propel businesses into the future of digital evolution.

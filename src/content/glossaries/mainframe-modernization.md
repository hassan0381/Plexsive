content_raw: At Maven Technologies, our goal is to help you optimize and modernize your businessâ€™s technological abilities, and one of the ways we achieve this is through mainframe modernization. Mainframe modernization, in essence, refers to the process through which we upgrade or migrate your existing mainframe system, honing in on several key areas - interface, code, cost, performance and maintainability. In more extensive modernization projects, this could involve the total migration of code and functions to a platform that utilizes state-of-the-art technology and is even cloud-hosted. There are numerous business benefits of mainframe modernization. To start, it helps reduce MIPS (millions of instructions per second) costs, a key factor in mainframe computing efficiency. Moreover, it unearths and simplifies access to retained business logic and data trapped within your mainframe system. Mainframe modernization also introduces the consumer to the exceptional capital expenditure (capex) benefits of the cloud, especially for fluctuating workloads. Moving to a cloud-based or plan can ensure your expenditure matches your usage, ensuring that you're not overspending on unused resources. One of the most compelling advantages of mainframe modernization is the speed it brings to development, deployment and release processes. Faster turnarounds mean you can deliver your products or services to the market at a quicker rate, providing you with a competitive edge. Embrace the power of elite technology with our professional, experienced team here at Maven Technologies and witness firsthand how mainframe modernization can unlock productivity and drive your business forward in the modern world.

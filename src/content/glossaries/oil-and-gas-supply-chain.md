content_raw: The oil and gas supply chain characterizes the comprehensive global processes that comprise the oil and gas industry, encompassing both domestic and international transactions, trading, shipping, procurement, as well as the visibility and management of inventories. This chain also encapsulates aspects such as material handling, import/export facilities and the dissemination of refined energy products originating from extraction sites to the end market. The supply chain is categorically divided into three sectors; upstream, midstream, and downstream. The upstream sector is devoted to detecting and extracting crude oil and natural gas, whereas the midstream sector focuses on the processing, storage, and transportation of these energy commodities. The downstream sector involves oil refineries, retail outlets, and the delivery companies of natural gas, shaping the final steps before reaching the end consumer. Given the intricacy due to multitudinous stages involved in energy processing, coupled with logistics and transportation, the oil and gas supply chain is inevitably complex. However, as global competition intensifies, industry professionals perceive that improvements in supply chain mechanisms are both essential and have significant cost-effective advantages. To enhance the value chains and streamline operations at every step of oil and gas production, industry professionals employ advanced digital technologies ranging from cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative team platforms and blockchain technologies. These digital systems assist in mitigating risk, optimizing warehouse inventory strategies, supervising the logistics of transportation, augmenting the customer experience, and ensuring the employment of optimal procurement strategies. Through realizing these operations, professionals in this sector continue to bolster the business benefits the oil and gas supply chain provides.

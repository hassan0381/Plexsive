content_raw: Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a significant process that encompasses the careful collection, analysis, and sharing of vital information about products. This process covers every phase of a product’s life from its initial design, manufacturing, sales, usage, maintenance, and eventual disposal or recycling. The advent of Digital PLM extends this data range beyond the usual enterprise restrictions and explores intelligence about real-world usage of products by customers. PLM offers multiple strategic business benefits. The analysis and sharing of the collected data from PLM enable manufacturers to promptly adapt their designs and incorporate innovative features. This swift adaptation meets the evolving market needs more rapidly and economically than competitors. PLM isn't solely restricted to product development; it extends far, playing a key role in the overall business model. The Digital PLM takes it a step further by adding the customer’s perspective to the data stored in PLM systems. This user feedback is a game-changer in the technology solution domain, enabling the inception of new business models. For instance, PLM can facilitate the sale of analytical data, aiding customers in making the most out of products.

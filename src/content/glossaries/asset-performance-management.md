content_raw: Asset Performance Management (APM) Defined Asset Performance Management, often referred to as APM, can be understood as a comprehensive approach to optimise operational data attained from interconnected devices. The primary goal of APM is to augment the efficiency and productivity of a workforce, simultaneously curbing overhead costs. A proficient APM strategy requires real-time, holistic insights that span multiple devices and locations. The key to successful APM lies in sophisticated data analysis to anticipate future trends, avert potential malfunction and ideally, implement automated asset management throughout the organisation. Business Advantages of Asset Performance Management Asset Performance Management offers a series of business benefits, paramount among which is its provision of a consistent and consolidated view of an organisation's assets, regardless of location. This acts as the single reliable source of information and an integrated platform for managing those assets. Better decision-making, stemming from improved insights, has a domino effect on the efficiency, availability, reliability and performance of assets. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in reducing costs and preventing outages via preemptive maintenance measures. An underrated advantage of APM lies in its capacity to automate pivotal processes such as scheduling. By eliminating manual intervention, the room for error is minimised, and costs are subsequently reduced. Concurrently, asset tracking not only aids regulatory compliance but optimises workforce management through process automation. In a nutshell, Asset Performance Management is a pivotal catalyst for unlocking productivity in organisations, seamlessly aligning with the vision of Maven Technologies - to bridge the gap between business benefits and elite technologies led by professionals.

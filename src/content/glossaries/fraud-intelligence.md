content_raw: Fraud Intelligence is a strategic method centered around the meticulous analysis of financial operations, aimed at detecting unusual activity and eliminating instances of fraud during or even before the execution of a transaction. This concept is particularly applicable in cases of check and credit card fraud. Various sectors, such as healthcare, insurance, and banking and financial services extensively benefit from fraud intelligence. It plays a crucial role in mitigating risks associated with medical billing fraud, insurance claim fraud, credit card fraud, and handwritten check fraud. The advantages of employing fraud intelligence extend far beyond just curbing illegal activities.

content_raw: IT/OT Convergence refers to the synergistic amalgamation of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. It represents the fusion of data from management systems, overseeing informational aspects including production plans and raw material shipments, with data from systems that directly supervise and control manufacturing processes such as temperature and pressure monitors in industries like oil refineries. Harnessing the collective power of IT/OT convergence can result in a host of strategic benefits for businesses. It equips companies with the ability to facilitate real-time decision-making, allowing them to swiftly respond to sudden changes or concerning issues that may arise. An effective IT/OT convergence drastically reduces the chances of unplanned downtime, optimising both the efficiency and productiveness of your equipment and staff. The integration of IT and OT systems can be comprehensive enough to render certain hardware and software redundant, resulting in their elimination. Such consolidation reduces both capital and operational expenses by ensuring no resource is underutilised or overused. At Maven Technologies, we bring unmatched expertise in the implementation of integrated IT/OT convergence systems, aligned with our passion for delivering high-performing technology solutions.

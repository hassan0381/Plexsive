content_raw: Insurance inspection drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are presently transforming the Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance landscape. This technology is utilized to capture detailed imagery and data that aid insurance risk assessments and claims management. Previously considered advanced, drone technology is quickly becoming mainstream. With estimations of 125,000 unit sales of drones in 2020, its adoption especially by commercial and personal-lines insurers has greatly improved property assessment approaches. The business benefits of insurance inspection drones cannot be overstated. 1. Boost in Business Efficiency Insurers often face difficulty in balancing customer experience with timely claim settlements, particularly in the face of catastrophes. Drones effectively alleviate this issue, as their ability to cover large property expanses in minimal time reduces the need for numerous field adjusters. 2. Expedited Claims Adjudication With inbuilt infrared cameras, drones accurately detect potential air and water leaks, which typically prolong the claims process. By harnessing this feature, insurers can significantly reduce time consumption and increase productivity, improving claim resolution time and customer satisfaction. 3. Enhanced Safety These drones negate the risks inherent in customary claims adjudication, such as adjusters needing to ascend ladders for damage inspection following hazardous events like fires, floods, or earthquakes. The drones' high-resolution image capturing capability makes them the safest option for property inspection. 4. Greater Accuracy Additionally, these drones facilitate close inspection of damage-inflicted areas without disturbing the scene. They provide detailed images and videos, which allow adjusters to comprehensively ascertain the cause of loss with minimal disturbance. This data can be seamlessly integrated into written reports, providing a more accurate understanding of the claim. At Maven Technologies, we are enthusiastic adopters of advanced technologies that optimize productivity.

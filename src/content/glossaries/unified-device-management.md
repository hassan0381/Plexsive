content_raw: What is Unified Device Management? Unified Device Management (UDM), also known as unified endpoint management, is a comprehensive platform designed to manage and safeguard an organization's diverse range of devices operating across its network. The broad scope of UDM encapsulates a vast range of devices - from smartphones to laptops, IoT edge devices to printers, and wearables - providing an ultimate solution for managing and securing applications and content on these devices within an enterprise environment. It also incorporates zero-touch device provisioning, delivering a ready-to-work experience for employees right from the first boot, complete with pre-installed applications and settings. The business benefits of Unified Device Management Implementing a UDM solution provides an enterprise numerous strategic advantages. For starters, it empowers organizations to accurately track, manage, physically protect, and secure its resources and data. This includes personal files, websites, and applications that employees access, share or otherwise interact with from their devices. Moreover, UDM offers organizations greater control over how employees access and exchange proprietary information. It safeguards confidential corporate information, allowing only authorized personnel and devices to access this data. As a versatile solution, UDM can effectively manage a diverse mobile environment including devices operating on iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows and macOS platforms. Most importantly, UDM allows corporations to design security and compliance policies to secure data and ensure these policies are consistently adhered to across both organization-owned and personal devices. This unification is achieved through a single, holistic solution, fostering an enhanced level of security and compliance across the organization. Investing in UDM is the first step towards unlocking productivity and fostering a secure, streamlined and efficient digital workspace ecosystem.

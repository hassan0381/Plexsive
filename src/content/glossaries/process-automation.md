content_raw: Process automation is the sophisticated technology practice of deploying robotics and intelligent automation in the day-to-day business processes. It strategically substitutes manual, repetitive, and mundane tasks with automated, efficient, and intelligent workflows. This form of automation can transform your business operation's dynamics, making it quicker, adept, and more profitable. With process automation, businesses of any scale can significantly lower their operating costs. It empowers them to focus more on higher-value work by reducing their dependency on human labour for mundane, repetitive tasks. Interestingly, this also offers better control of their resources, allowing them to reposition and refocus their human talent where they are most required.

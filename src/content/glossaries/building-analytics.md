content_raw: Building Analytics Explained Building analytics refer to data analytics derived from intelligent building technologies like networked sensors, building management systems (BMSs), integrated workplace management systems (IWMSs) and internet of things (IoT) edge devices. These advanced technologies generate considerable data about building infrastructure, providing crucial insights on system conditions and performance to facility owners and managers. Your Business Benefits from Building Analytics Scrutinizing and analysing data from smart building technologies empowers businesses to manage various facility systems such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, plumbing, and security/access more effectively. Building analytics ultimately empower businesses to - Benchmark, assess, and compare facilities performance - Predict and budget utility consumption meticulously - Understand and explain events via intelligent correlation of parameters - Balance performance indicators without compromising on any vital factors, such as occupant comfort versus energy efficiency - Carry out predictive maintenance to prevent unexpected equipment failures - Implement new features or functionalities leveraging building analytics How Building Analytics Harness IT With the evolution of information technology, building automation systems are being equipped with an “informed infrastructure”, amalgamating building hardware with building analytics software. This transformation adds capabilities to building systems that were once unimaginable, now allowing users to monitor, measure, analyze, communicate, and control building operations in a more granular way. Demand Management Platform – The Future of Building Analytics A demand management platform is designed as a continuous data import tool. It gathers information from outside enterprises, processes it into actionable data, communicates recommended actions to the building, comprehends the building’s response, and shares select information externally. The platform provides the ability to design strategies for various physical assets, i.e., complete buildings or specific spaces within, as well as associated equipment and energy meters. It provides managers the flexibility to schedule consumption across various parameters like comfort, occupancy, equipment type, time of day, pricing etc. The platform makes the alignment of energy consumption with these parameters possible by adopting predefined load-shedding methods based on individual agreements. It adds capabilities to automatically recognize and adjust demand in a predefined manner.

content_raw: Building technologies, often referred to as smart building technologies, are a sophisticated set of systems designed to enhance the operational efficiency of a facility. These technologies encompass systems such as, but not limited to, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, security, and access. Leveraging innovative solutions such as networked sensors, building management systems (BMSs), integrated workplace management systems (IWMSs), and Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, these technologies continuously collate and provide key data about the condition and performance of various facility systems. The primary objective is to ensure better energy efficiency, employee safety, wellness, convenience, and productivity. Bringing modern technology into building management can revolutionize how we use and experience spaces, whether they are places of work or public facilities. From a business standpoint, the benefits of employing building technologies are manifold. Particularly valuable in the sphere of facilities management during and in the aftermath of events like a pandemic, these technologies can significantly enhance the workplace experience, increasing overall employee productivity and aiding in achieving sustainability goals. With the ability to access real-time data and monitor the performance of facilities remotely from any part of the globe, businesses can effectively manage their real estate portfolios and logically rationalize their physical footprints. Building technologies establish a single reliable source of data, fostering increased transparency and trust during evaluations and negotiations with real estate agents. Above all, building technologies can provide substantial improvement in operational efficiencies of facilities, allowing businesses to share industry-specific best practices and learnings across their portfolio. Embracing smart building technology not only makes fiscal sense, it is also an investment in the future, echoing Maven Technologies' vision of delivering value at scale with solutions for the modern world.

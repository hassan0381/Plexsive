content_raw: Insurance telematics is a progressive technology deployed widely to monitor driving behaviour. By tracking, measuring, and transmitting a spectrum of data points from a GPS-based device installed inside a vehicle, the technology analyses speed, distance, location, braking and cornering, and several other parameters. The ultimate aim is to underpin usage-based insurance (UBI) programs, thus bringing about a transformative change in the conventional auto insurance business model. The principal business advantage of insurance telematics lies in its capacity to allow insurance providers to price premiums and policies more accurately. Precise pricing, based on extensive data generated through telematics, ensures that insurance rates truly portray the risk linked to insuring customers. This guarantees stable business operations, eliminating significant rate fluctuations that can lead to loss of customers. Insurance telematics empowers insurance companies to amass substantial data, thus enabling the development of advanced risk models to reduce overall risk exposure. Indeed, if insurers choose to undertake higher risk, telematics-based data ensures that their premiums commensurate with their exposure. Through the integration of insurance telematics data into central systems—policy administration, actuarial and underwriting, billing and claims, as well as new policyholder portals that trigger actions—insurance providers can make robust, quick decisions, potentially in real time. Insurance telematics heightens efficiency by mechanising manual, time-consuming processes. Geo-spatial and vehicle data are used to automate these processes, resulting in streamlined workflow. Arguably, insurance telematics is instrumental in developing new products. The technology facilitates the creation of usage-based insurance programs that offer discounts to customers by rewarding them for sensible driving behaviour. Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) programs, enabled by insurance telematics, are gaining popularity among customers. Thus, insurance telematics not only enhances productivity and reduces risk but also unlocks a new customer-centric approach to insurance services.

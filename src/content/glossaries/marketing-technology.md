content_raw: Marketing Technology, often referred to as martech, is a sector of customer relationship management (CRM) that strategically utilises digital tools to optimise marketing operations, processes, and activities. These tools assist businesses in achieving a multitude of objectives such as identifying and nurturing prospective customers, personalising customer relations, and quantifying campaign effectiveness. Standard components of a martech software "stack" could include programmatic ad platforms, marketing automation software, content management systems (CMSs), web analytics, and digital customer experience platforms.  The implementation of martech can provide a broad range of business benefits - Democratisation Martech offers the opportunity for small or regional-based businesses to extend their influence, allowing them to compete on a national or even international scale. - Trendspotting The combination of big data with artificial intelligence (AI) empowers marketers to more effectively identify and act upon emerging consumer trends. - Enhanced Networking The use of social media technologies not only bolsters your business connections but serves as a subtler marketing method compared to traditional, direct approaches. - Targeted Advertising Incorporating website consumer tracking technologies allows the delivery of hyper-personalised content and offers to consumers, leading to far more efficient advertising campaigns. - Easy measurement Martech enables the recording and measuring of online marketing campaigns using key metrics, providing marketing leaders with valuable data to make more informed decisions.

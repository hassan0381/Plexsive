content_raw: Hybrid Cloud A Hybrid cloud is a comprehensive computing environment that harmoniously utilises a mix of on-premise, private cloud, and public cloud services. This optimised combination houses an organizationâ€™s data and applications, shifting the paradigm of how infrastructure and applications are deployed. This new approach has emerged from the continued digital transformation of businesses, offering improved business agility and effective support for customer experience and competitive advantage-focused business priorities. The core business benefit of a hybrid cloud is its ability to offer unmatched agility, accelerating an enterprise's ability to adapt, pivot and transfer data and applications as required. This adaptive environment facilitates seamless, secure orchestration of workloads across a diverse range of cloud landing zones. Therefore, a hybrid cloud-based strategy can spearhead the efficient transition of legacy applications, modernisation of core platforms, and creation of an agile IT backbone to support future workflows and processes. However, the journey to implement an effective hybrid cloud strategy comes with its unique set of challenges. These hurdles include strained resources, delivery delays, dependencies on legacy infrastructure, and most crucially, lack of strategic business and technical partnerships. Many organizations find themselves struggling to bridge the gap between what optimally should be done versus what actually can be done. The primary culprit for this disparity is the scarcity of appropriate resources like technically proficient IT staff and required technologies.

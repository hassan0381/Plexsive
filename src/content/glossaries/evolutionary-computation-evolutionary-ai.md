content_raw: Evolutionary computation (EC) or evolutionary AI is a technology concept that harnesses the principles of natural evolution to foster innovative and complex solutions. Unlike traditional engineering or design methodologies where humans are tasked with crafting, debugging, and deploying solutions, evolutionary AI enables the generation of unique, creative solutions that may be too intricate or unconventional for humans to conceive. In the realm of evolutionary computation, human engineers determine the measurement of potential solutions' quality (i.e., the fitness) and the variety of solutions possible (i.e., the search space). With such parameters, evolutionary programming can resolve any challenges within sectors such as engineering, healthcare, life sciences, insurance, or business. Illustrative applications include neural network structures, plant growth formulas, electric circuits, and even sports schedules. Among the potential answers, evolutionary algorithms will identify those with the highest quality. This technology is ideally suited for in-depth analyses where it's impracticable for individuals to assess all variable interactions promptly. The process commences with a diverse initial population of possible solutions. Each solution undergoes evaluation with the population rank ordered. Least useful solutions undergo removal and replacement with the beneficial solutions' offspring, achieved by mutation and recombination of the latter. This "evaluation-selection-recombination" loop repeats, gradually producing better-suited candidates until satisfactory results are achieved. From a business perspective, revolutionary computation offers immense advantages. Companies striving to enhance designs or processes often find it daunting when the number of variables surpasses around 15. It results in a sea of millions of possible solutions where these variables interplay. Dealing with such a vast count of variables is impracticable for humans. Evolutionary computation serves as an unrelenting solution-creation engine in these cases. The results generated by evolutionary AI are not only feasible but also often unexpected. These uniquely tailored solutions to human-defined problems amplify human problem-solving capabilities. Furthermore, the strength of Maven Technologies' proprietary evolutionary computation solution can resolve some of the world's most intricate business problems. Its intrinsically parallelizable nature allows it to evaluate millions of prospective solutions across thousands of CPUs. Hence, it stands competent in scaling to significant challenges.
